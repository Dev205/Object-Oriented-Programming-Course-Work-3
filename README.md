# Object-Oriented-Programming-Course-Work-3
Created a program that uses a Double Linked List, Swipe GUI and has data persistence.
The goal was to create a program that would be used by a receptionist, nurse and doctor. This would store patients details and allow the users to view these details.
It also keeps track of the most recent patient, who would then be seen by the nurse. The nurse then gives the patient a prioriyt, and depending on the priortiy/time of arrival the doctor would see the next patient.
At the end of this the patient is removed from the DLL but the dta is still stored in a data base. Used SQL lite and Java.
